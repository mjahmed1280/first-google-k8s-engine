# Flask App on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

My first Kubernetes deployment learning project on Google Cloud Platform.

---

## What I Did

This project demonstrates:
- Creating a Flask application
- Containerizing it with Docker
- Pushing the image to Google Artifact Registry
- Deploying to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Exposing the app publicly with a LoadBalancer service
- Verifying everything works end-to-end

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Created a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Cloud

I created a GKE cluster with 2 small machines.

```bash
gcloud container clusters create learning-cluster --zone asia-south1-a --num-nodes 2 --machine-type e2-small
```

---

### 2. Checked That the Cluster is Working

Verified that the cluster machines (nodes) are ready.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

---

### 3. Created a Docker Repository on Google Cloud

This is where Docker images are stored.

```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create k8-flask-test --repository-format=docker --location=asia-south1 --description="Docker repo for flask backend"
```

---

### 4. Tagged the Flask Docker Image

Gave the local Docker image a Google Cloud name.

```bash
docker tag test-app:latest asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/gcp-test-project/k8-flask-test/test-app:1.0
```

---

### 5. Checked Docker Images on System

```bash
docker image ls
```

---

### 6. Authenticated Docker with Google Cloud

Allowed pushing images to Google Cloud.

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev
```

---

### 7. Pushed Docker Image to Artifact Registry

Uploaded the Flask image to Google Cloud.

```bash
docker push asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/gcp-test-project/k8-flask-test/test-app:1.0
```

---

### 8. Confirmed Image Exists in Artifact Registry

```bash
gcloud artifacts docker images list asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/gcp-test-project/k8-flask-test
```

---

### 9. Created Kubernetes Deployment YAML

The `deployment.yaml` file contains:
- 2 replicas (copies) of the Flask app
- Image from Artifact Registry
- Correct container port configuration

---

### 10. Applied the Deployment to the Cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

---

### 11. Checked That Pods are Running

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

---

### 12. Created Kubernetes Service YAML

The `service.yaml` file contains:
- LoadBalancer service type
- Maps port 80 to the app's internal port
- Exposes the app publicly

---

### 13. Applied the Service to the Cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

---

### 14. Got the Public External IP

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

This shows the external IP address where the app is accessible.

---

### 15. Verified the Flask App is Running

Opened the external IP in a browser and confirmed the Flask app is responding.

---

### 16. Checked Application Logs

```bash
kubectl logs -l app=flask-backend
```

Output confirmed:
```
Hello from Flask on Kubernetes!
```

---

## Final Result

**Flask app is running on Google Kubernetes Engine and accessible using a public IP.** ✅

## Files in This Project

- `app.py` - Flask application
- `Dockerfile` - Docker container configuration
- `deployment.yaml` - Kubernetes Deployment manifest
- `service.yaml` - Kubernetes Service manifest
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

---

## Key Learnings

1. Docker containerizes applications for consistency
2. Artifact Registry stores Docker images in Google Cloud
3. Kubernetes manages containerized apps at scale
4. GKE handles Kubernetes infrastructure on Google Cloud
5. Services expose apps to the internet
6. LoadBalancer provides public access
